Until now, we have been observing our JavaScript universe from the surface of our planet. We have familiarized ourselves with the values that populate our universe from a distance, but in this module, we’re changing that. We’re going to hop in a spaceship and go exploring, introducing ourselves to every value in our JavaScript universe.

Spending the time to look at each value in detail might feel unnecessary, but you can only say there are “two apples” when you clearly see that they’re two _distinct_ apples. Distinguishing values from one another is key to understanding _equality_ in JavaScript—which will be our next topic.

Our spaceship will guide us through the “celestial spheres” of JavaScript to meet different values. We’ll meet the primitive values first: Booleans, Numbers, Strings, and so on. Later, we’ll meet Objects and Functions. Consider it a sightseeing tour.

### Undefined

We’ll start our tour with the Undefined type. This is a very straightforward place to start, because **there is only one value of this type—`undefined`**.

```js
console.log(typeof(undefined));
```

It’s called undefined, so you might think it’s not there—but it _is_ a value, and a very real one! Like a black hole, `undefined` is grumpy and can often spell trouble. For example, reading a property from it will break your program:

```js
let person = undefined;

console.log(person.mood); 
```

Oh, well. Luckily, there is only one `undefined` in our entire JavaScript universe. You might wonder: why does it exist at all? In JavaScript, it represents the concept of an _unintentionally_ missing value.

You could use it in your own code by writing `undefined`—like you write `2` or `"hello"`. However, `undefined` _also_ commonly “occurs naturally.” It shows up in some situations where JavaScript doesn’t know what value you wanted. For example, if you forget to assign a variable, it will point to `undefined`:

```js
let bandersnatch;

console.log(bandersnatch);
```
