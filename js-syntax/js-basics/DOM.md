## What is DOM? 
- DOM stands for Document Object Model.
- It is a bunch of JS objects that you can interact with.
- It represents the page (HTML+CSS) so that programs can access every node in the document to make changes to the document.

 `console.dir()` is a method used to print an interactive list of the properties of the specified JavaScript object.
